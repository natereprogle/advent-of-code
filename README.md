# Hey there!
This repo contains my solutions for Advent of Code. Each folder is named for the year. For example, 2023's Calendar is in the `2023` folder.

This is just for examples! I likely won't be the best at this, but I can get it done at least! If you have suggestions on how to better complete the challenges, open a PR! :\)
