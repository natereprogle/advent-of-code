# Hey there!

This repo contains my solutions for Advent of Code. Each folder is named for the year. For example, 2023's Calendar is in the `2023` folder.

This is just for examples! I likely won't be the best at this, but I can get it done at least! If you have suggestions on how to better complete the challenges, open a PR! :\)

To run the scripts, first `pnpm install` followed by `pnpm run day <year> <day> <part>`. For example, if you wanted to run day 3's part 2 from the year 2023, you'd enter `pnpm run day 2023 3 2`.
